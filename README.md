## Goal:
Suppose that we're building an app that recommends movies. Using a large set of reviews off the web, we would like to recommend only movies with positive reviews. I use the Naive Bayes algorithm to train a binary sentiment classifier with a dataset of movie reviews. The task is to learn a bag of words (unigram, bigram) model that will classify a review as positive or negative based on the words it contains.

## Requirements:
```
python3
numpy
nltk
scikit-learn
```
## Running:
For help run:
```
python3 mp3.py -h
```
